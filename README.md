# Progress Log

[0824 MON](#0824-MON)

## 0824 MON

- Finally added `node_modules` to the `.gitignore` file, long overdue! Install dependencies in `package.json` with `npm install`
- `--save-dev` is used for node packages that are not needed for the end user
- Actually read about how to install [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) and [eslint-config-prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-prettier) on their respective websites, the installation via npm makes a lot more sense now
- Updated basic website [layout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdJMM5lIKNM)!
- Turned on auto save so we don't waste over 9000 keystrokes on `:w`
- Finally figured out that the github buttons are called [shields](https://shields.io/), added commit & repo size shields
